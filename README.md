# Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Checco!!!

- ðŸ˜„ I am a PhD student in QML and AI in the context of healthcare/medical imaging at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), collaborating with Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC).
  In particular, I work both in digital and analog quantum computing, focusing on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), encoding schemes, and quantum annealers (QAs) to solve combinatorial
  optimization problems (COPs). I plan to get much experience using different tools and frameworks. Moreover, I would also like to try tensor networks (TNs) for
  large circuits and physical systems.
- ðŸ‘€ Love eating, chess, outdoor sports, thinking, meeting people, hanging out, programming, learning, AI, quantum, and sooo on...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly improving myself and my skills since I have lots of things to learn!
